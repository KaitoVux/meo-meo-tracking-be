# Notification and Validation System

This module implements Task 6 requirements for the Business Expense Tracking System, providing comprehensive notification and validation capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Notification Service (`notification.service.ts`)
- **Core notification management**: Create, read, update, and delete notifications
- **User-specific notifications**: Get notifications for specific users with filtering
- **Status management**: Mark notifications as read/dismissed
- **Automatic cleanup**: Delete old notifications
- **Specialized notification types**:
  - Missing fields notifications
  - Invoice collection reminders
  - Status change notifications

### 2. Validation Notification Service (`validation-notification.service.ts`)
- **Real-time validation**: Validates expense data and sends notifications for missing fields
- **Critical field detection**: Identifies and prioritizes critical missing fields
- **Feedback system**: Provides warnings and suggestions for expense improvements
- **Accountant notifications**: Notifies accountants of validation issues

### 3. Reminder Service (`reminder.service.ts`)
- **Invoice collection reminders**: Automatic reminders when expenses are marked as paid
- **Overdue tracking**: Identifies and sends urgent reminders for overdue invoices
- **Incomplete submission tracking**: Reminds users about draft expenses
- **Daily digest**: Summary of pending actions for users
- **Payment request reminders**: Alerts for missing payment request links

### 4. Database Schema
- **Notification entity**: Complete notification data model with relationships
- **Indexing**: Optimized queries for user notifications and types
- **Soft delete**: Maintains notification history
- **Metadata support**: Flexible additional data storage

## API Endpoints
